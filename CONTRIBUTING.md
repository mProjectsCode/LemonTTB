# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to LemonTTB. Your help is greatly appreciated.

Following these guidelines helps to make it easier on both sides to work on this project.

# Ground Rules
Please make sure you read these rules to save me and you some time.
- Ensure that your contributions build without errors.
- Before implementing a feature, create an issue and get some feedback on it, to save you and me some time.
- Please follow the Java naming conventions.

# So you want to add a feature to the bot
- Start by creating an issue on GitHub to discuss and get feedback on your idea. This will possibly save you from possibly rewriting all your additions.
- After you got a thumbs up on your idea start by creating a fork of the code.
- Then do the changes on your fork.
- If your code builds and follows the Java coding standards you can create a pull request.

# So you found a bug that you want to report
- Start by looking if there is a newer version that fixes your bug.
- Then look if the issue hasn't been reported before.
- If that doesn't apply, create an issue on GitHub.
- Make sure the to accurately describe the bug and how to reproduce it. 
- Also, if possible append the important part of the log in the issue.
