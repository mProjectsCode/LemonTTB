### Currently under heavy development.

At some point this is going to be a discord bot that aims to assist the GM during table-top sessions.

The documentation will appear at some point in the near future on my [website](https://mprojectscode.github.io).

Starting the application will start a spring boot server on port 8080. From there the bot can be started and stoped.
More features for the web interface are currently in development.

# Features
Finished Features (still need some good polish):
- some internal foundations like a logger and the foundation for playing audio
- Playing local and external audio
- A permission system
- A name mapping feature (map ids of players to "nicknames" for faster reference in commands)
- Moving people to a secondary "tips" voice channel
- Deaf-muteing people

Features in development:
- A web interface for easier management of the bot.

Planed Features:
- Access to session logs via commands
- Show pictures via link or path to local file
